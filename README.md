# React + Scss + Webpack
Nothing fancy. Just a starting point for myself when creating webapps with React and Scss. Contains the following:
- React
- Scss
- Livereload
- Webpack Visualiser plugin

I'm pretty noob with webpack so there's a lot of things id like to build into this over time as I get more comfortable with being a front-end dev (been working as a designer for the past few years).

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
  ``npm install``

2. Run start script:
  ``npm start``

3. When building a dist folder:
  ``npm run-script build``
