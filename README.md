# Påmind Frontend Test
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/05a71525-28df-4011-82e6-c0494fd0708e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/amazing-mestorf-23f6b4/deploys)

Built this for my work assignment for Påmind. Live version of the site [can be seen here](https://amazing-mestorf-23f6b4.netlify.com/). I'm using my [react-scss-webpack](https://github.com/kevinolsson/react-scss-webpack) repo as a starting point.

To view locally simply clone, run `npm install` and then `npm start`

Things I felt I could have done better:
- Implement Redux
- Better parity between my components and sass files
- Thrown in some motion
